This repo allows to easily install a postgres database and adminer.
For that we use docker-compose.
After [installing docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/), just run `docker compose up` in the root directory of the repository.

The database name is database.
To verify that the database is up goto [localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888), you should land on an adminer page
